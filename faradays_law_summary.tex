\section{Faraday's Law of Induction}
In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered that a changing magnetic field within a loop of wire induces an electromotive force (emf). This is the fundamental principle behind electrical generators and various forms of inductive electronics.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
The induced emf ($\mathcal{E}$) in a loop is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux ($\Phi_B$) through the loop:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
\end{equation}
where the negative sign is due to Lenz's Law, indicating that the induced emf creates a current whose magnetic field opposes the change in flux.

\section{Motional emf}
A conductor moving through a magnetic field experiences a force that creates an emf. If the conductor is part of a circuit, this emf can drive a current.

\subsection{Application in Railguns and Meters}
Motional emf can be used in railguns, where a sliding conductor accelerates due to the Lorentz force, and in meters that measure flow rates using magnetic fields.

\section{Lenz's Law}
Lenz's Law gives the direction of the induced current: it opposes the change that produced it, a consequence of conservation of energy and Newton's third law.

\subsection{Conservation Principles}
Lenz's Law can be viewed as a manifestation of the conservation of energy or as a consequence of Newton's third law applied to electromagnetic forces.

\section{Induced emf and Electric Fields}
A changing magnetic field induces an electric field, which can exist even in free space, without the need for a physical conductor.

\subsection{Maxwell's Addition to Ampère's Law}
Maxwell included the displacement current in Ampère's Law, which allows for the prediction of induced electric fields in the absence of conductors.

\section{Generators and Motors}
Generators transform mechanical energy into electrical energy via induction. Motors do the reverse, using electric currents to produce mechanical motion.

\subsection{AC and DC Generators}
The principles of induction apply to both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) generators, with different configurations to suit each type.

\section{Eddy Currents}
Eddy currents are loops of induced current that can cause significant heating in conductors and can be utilized for electromagnetic braking.

\subsection{Mitigation Techniques}
Eddy currents can be minimized by using laminated magnetic cores, which reduce losses in transformers and motors.

\section{Practice Problems}
Here you would typically include problems that apply the discussed concepts, followed by detailed solutions.

\section{Detailed Examples}
